This one on North Bridge seems to always be packed, I guess it attracts the tourists. The restaurant itself is nice enough while attempting to maintain authenticity. The staff are usually nice but the service can be a little slow due to how busy it is. But everything just seems a little bland and boring, as it is just another chain restaurant. It lacks the charm that those authentic little Italian restaurants have. The menu offers your standard Italian food, and if you look online you can usually find money off vouchers. Hence my reason for ever going. I usually end up getting a panini or burger, I know that isn't exactly Italian but looking at my dining partners pasta I have never been too impressed. And I like chips. 

I will say that their ""Godfather"" dessert is pretty good. I am a sucker for fatty, chocolatey, ice-creamy desserts that come in big bowls and that does just that. 

I would probably give this place a miss and head to one of the more authentic Italian restaurants because the food will be miles better.",review,Wuo1WKSgEt42fY7NxXcJYw,"{u'funny': 1, u'useful': 0, u'cool': 0}"

Decent but dreary Italian food ""jus like-a mamma use-da make eh"", assuming your mamma is a 20 stone welder from Pilton, you know exactly what to expect from here.

What you won't expect though, is penne with duck, spring onions and plum sauce.

I came here with some friends a few months ago.  Although the food was good, you can definitely find better in the locality for far cheaper.  The menu has a good range of authentic Italian dishes and I went for the penne with chicken in a roasted pepper and wine sauce.

THAT is not how Italian food is done. How would I know? Oh, I don't know, perhaps my many years of holidaying in Italy itself for months on end, perhaps my many, many Italian friends who have taught me over the years how to make a proper pasta, perhaps the fact that I have functioning taste-buds. Something which the kitchen-staff here seems to be lacking.

The service: we ordered, and the waiter was rude to the point of snatching, not taking the menus away from us. When out choices arrived and he tried to get the attention of one of our friends to alert her that her dish had arrived, he yelled, -no really he YELLED- ""OI CALZONE!"" at her. Conversation stopped dead, we all stared. The tables next to us stared. Rudest waiter experience I've ever had, in my life. And I've been to Paris multiple times so that's saying quite a lot.
For the duration of the night he was extremely embarrassed, but suffice to say that we didn't leave a tip.

The food: ugh. Ugh, ugh, ugh. When you look at the food and think: ""Should've gone to Domino's.."" you know it's bad. I had the Calimari, ... I think? It tasted like deep-fried breadcrumbs with croutons inside of them instead of calimari. Next to it was a greasy, uninspired, over-salted sauce which should've come with fish 'n chips instead of a dainty starter. 

And the thing that pisses me off the most is that I paid 5.85 for the privilege of getting my taste buds assaulted, yelled at by a waiter, and ogled by the rest of the (male) staff in a manner which was so insulting, I'll not repeat it here.

Oh, and did I mention that our jug of water contained half a chopped at lemon (you know the one you find behind at the back of your fridge, all dried up, that one) AND a piece of wax. Yes, there was a large piece of candle-wax in my glass of water.

Food :-
A friend had ordered for me as I was getting ready in the hotel room so by the time I arrived it was slightly cold, the waiter offered to heat it up for me, which he did. Upon tasting the food the mushrooms were slightly burnt - the chicken was fine and nothing special. The potatoes tasted as if someone had thrown a heap of salt on them which wasn't that good.

The table was bare save napkins and cutlery. Our waitress provided the menus. 
We took wine and I had a pasta with prawns and chilli. Lovely. 

Now for the best part: they have just recently introduced ""mini desserts"" - Yes sir. 
You can order 3 or 5 desserts and they come in shot glasses - pannacotta, banana toffee (Banoffee), tiramisu, cheesecake and a deep chocolate ganache like thingy.

Then we noticed a confrontation between a member of the waitstaff and a disgruntled customer. I am not sure what had happened but it was enough to rattle the customers nearby and my wife, who was opposite me on the other side of the bar area. Next, I had ordered a gin and tonic and it was all tonic with about 4 ice cubes in a glass a bit bigger than a highball glass . The last straw was when we got the desert. I had ordered their desert shooters wanting something sweet. I had the banana coffee which was really good, the tiramisu and the cheesecake. I had finished the banana one, went half way through the tiamisu and decided to try the cheesecake. The cheesecake had not had a chance to set and was runny which was really dissappointing. I went back to the tiramisu and the NEXT BITE HIT A PIECE OF PLASTIC! I told our waiter and he brought the manager over and he apologized and offered us something else. I didnt want to take my chances so I asked for the check. He said he would comp our deserts and when the check came he only took mime off.... I just paid and left.
