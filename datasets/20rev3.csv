Unfortunately, I tend to forget why Gino's pizza is the most awful pizza place in Arizona.

About every four years I forget that they use the world's worst watered down sauce, synthetic tasting, plastic-like cheeses and toppings, and a crust that seems to only consist of equal portions of flour and water. That leads to forcing myself into a journey that reminds me that this place is a poor excuse for a pizza parlor.

It's clear this place has a steady stream of customers, (the owner flaunts an ever changing sports car out front of the restaurant). How else could he afford to drive nice vehicles? That leads me to believe that there are like-minded saps who make a residual journey every few years to find out why it's been so long since there last visit.

On a positive nod to nostalgia, they still have the same arcade games I fed quarters to as a child. That tends to bring a lighter side to each visit.


It is very clear that this is the worst pizza (find out for yourself!), but at least you can always rely on the on that consistency.",review,IKJR3VafpwuJr7ILYnSO7Q,"{u'funny': 8, u'useful': 5, u'cool': 2}"

Now keep in mind. I am praising them for their namesake... PIZZA. Anything else ... such as wings... is not so good.

I don't know that I'm a fan of the crust, but there's not much of it and I am a fan of that. Plus, I was impressed to find tasty fresh red onions on our veggie pizza (weird that this simple ingredient is remarkable, but it was), and overall good toppings with slightly above average sauce. I vow to immediately stop ordering from the chain place around the corner unless I'm really desperate -- all future business goes to Gino's when I'm in the neighborhood and looking for takeout.

Which makes it very hard to write this review. Gino's is only 2 miles from me, and it is an independently owned mom and pop type place, so when something like this exists in South Phoenix I want desperately to like it.

The sad reality, for both Gino's and myself, is that this is truly the worst pizza I've ever had. When I say that I mean almost inedible. It's basically a technicality that this pizza passes as edible. For instance the ingredients within may be common for your average pizza, It may even look like pizza, but on every other level something is just wrong with it.

Visually the pizza, while looking like a pizza (round in shape with cheese and sauce), is disheartening at first glance before you even taste it. Unfortunately this is one of the times you can judge a book by a cover. When you bite into a slice it sort of has this film of water to it. Something that immediately forms a barrier between your taste buds and the slice.

Often you will see pizza boxes display that their mozzarella is 100% REAL dairy cheese. When you eat Gino's you can't help wondering if they left that off their boxes for legal reasons. The cheese has this rubbery plastic type texture to it and seems to be absent of taste.This is sub-sub-store brand cheese, in fact it seems like it would be a challenge in itself to acquire a blend of materials so consistently awful. The crust is like cardboard, sometimes even a little burnt. I don't know how this crust was made. It's almost like every time a vital ingredient was left out of the cooking process rendering the pretty funky tasting. It's almost like the main goal of the crust was merely to house the toppings, not to be eaten. 

It's so rare i eat a pizza that is disappointing on every level, but in this case that's Gino's. I have traveled around the United States. Ate pizza in New York and in comparison Wyoming and it's trippy to think that the worst pizza i've had is 2 miles from me.

Maybe some day Gino's will go through big changes. that would be great because I really wanted this place to be ""my pizza place"".",review,MosHkNo5EpYkJ1j9yocrIw,"{u'funny': 0, u'useful': 2, u'cool': 0}"

Ordered my pie, stopped over, picked it up, and had a great conversation with the dude working the counter.

Second trip?

Ordered online.  Made a stop at Walgreens being that I was told by the site that it would be 25 minutes.  Stopped in, no pizza ready.  Instead, I was told they didn't make it because I didn't answer the call they made to me.  I checked my phone right there, no missed calls.  I was all ""Alright, dude, no worries, cook me up a quick pepperoni, canadian bacon, and green olives"" which he was happy to do.  Told me it would be 10 - 15 minutes.  25 - 35 minutes later, pizza is done.  Get it home, no canadian bacon.  I even tipped those assholes thinking I screwed something up.

Go somewhere better.  While waiting, I saw them opening giant cans of pre-made pizza sauce.  They may have been around for 40 years, but buying store-bought pizza sauce for over priced pizza doesn't make much sense.
